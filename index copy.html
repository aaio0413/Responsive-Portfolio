                <p> Hello everyone!! I am an internatinal business student at Mills College and also pursuing CS certificate simultaneously.
                I'm from Japan. So, of course I do love Anime. My favorite Anime of all time is "GHOST IN THE SHELL". This anime series are composed of 3 anime seasons (technically 5), 
                2 animation movies, and latest short animation movie series (4 one hour movies). There's even its live-action movie HOLLYWOOD made, however, don't watch it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p> The movie is almost nothing to do with original Anime series, and it sucked. As a huge fun of Ghost In The Shell, I watched the movie at theater. Turns out, I was deeply disappointed and shamed that even the movie got title of Ghost In The Shell.</p>
            <p> Anyway, my point is, I am a very friendly and kind person. </p>
